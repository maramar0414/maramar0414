**Hi there!** 👋 (Emoji-hand waving)

Welcome to my coding journey! 🚀

**Note: This readme is a work in progress.**

In November 2022, I embarked on my coding adventure with FreeCodeCamp, diving into the realms of **HTML** and **CSS**. By March 2023, I delved into my first **JavaScript** tutorial. The turning point in my learning expedition happened in September 2023 when I accelerated into the world of web development at the **School of Code**. Here's a glimpse of what I've covered:

- 💡 **Foundations**
- 💻 Crafting useful code and interfaces
- ✨ **UI/UX Design**
- 📑 Understanding data and its interactions
- 🧪 Building robust code through testing
- 🧩 Embracing component-based thinking with **React**
- 🧱 Advanced **React** concepts
- ⚒️ Real-world project week
- 💪 Engineering robust, maintainable software

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/maria-araque) to connect or inquire about my coding journey. Currently, I'm engaged in a wellbeing website project—more details available upon request.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
